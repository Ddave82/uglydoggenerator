🎨 Prompt Used for Image Generation

Current AI prompt (English translation):

Create a realistic portrait of an extremely ugly and comically looking dog. The dog should have unusual, asymmetric facial features, such as a crooked jaw, differently sized, bulging eyes, scruffy, unkempt fur, a crooked nose, and protruding teeth. The overall image should look bizarre, but humorous. The background should be neutral and blurry, so that the focus is entirely on the dog. Realistic style, high level of detail.
